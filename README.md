# Building-Conversational-Experiences-with-Dialogflow-Coursework


## Introduction
This repo contains all my work for the course, [Building Conversational Experiences with Dialogflow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conversational-experiences-dialogflow?skipBrowseRedirect=true) offered by Google Cloud on Coursera.


## Course Work

1. [Week 1 (PizzaBot)](https://github.com/urvi367/Building-Conversational-Experiences-with-Dialogflow-CourseWork/blob/master/PizzaBot.zip)
    - Build a conversational agent for a **pizza restaurant** using **Dialogflow** that will let users place orders.
    - Define intents for a pizza-ordering use case to match typical user queries.
    - Identify entities to extract data from user queries.
    - Add input and output context to the pizza ordering intent to maintain continuity.
    - Setup fulfilment as **Cloud Functions** code for the agent to be able to store orders in **Cloud Datastore**.
    
2. Week 2
    - Use **Cloud Datalab**, Python, data science libraries, and **Google Natural Language API's** to transform an unstructured text document into a structured knowledge base in **Cloud Datastore**. Basically, extract topics and associated policy text from a Human Resources Manual.
    - Use Dialogflow to build a conversational agent that can respond to questions about this document.
    - Populate entities from Datastore into the **Dialogflow agent**.
    - Use **AppEngine** to deploy a **Webhook API** that queries the text associated with topics.
    - Use AppEngine to deploy a **customized front-end** for the chat agent.
    - Add basic **authentication** to webhook to allow only secure web requests.
