# Building-Conversational-Experiences-with-Dialogflow-Coursework


## Introduction
This repo contains all my work for the course, [Building Conversational Experiences with Dialogflow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conversational-experiences-dialogflow?skipBrowseRedirect=true) offered by Google Cloud on Coursera.


## Course Work

1. [Week 1 (PizzaBot)](https://github.com/urvi367/Building-Conversational-Experiences-with-Dialogflow-CourseWork/blob/master/PizzaBot.zip)
    - Build a conversational agent for a **pizza restaurant** using Dialogflow that will let users place orders.
    - Define intents for a pizza-ordering use case to match typical user queries.
    - Identify entities to extract data from user queries.
    - Add input and output context to the pizza ordering intent to maintain continuity.
    - Setup fulfilment as Cloud Functions code for the agent to be able to store orders in Cloud Datastore.
    
2. Week 2
    - Use Cloud Datalab, Python, data science libraries, and Google Natural Language API's machine learning technology to transform an unstructured text document into a structured knowledge base in Cloud Datastore.
    - Use Dialogflow to build a conversational agent that can respond to questions about the HR manual.
    - Populate entities from Datastore into the Dialogflow agent.
    - Use an existing angular code from github to setup a custom UI for the **HR chatbot**.
    - Deploy a python webhook on AppEngine to handle lookup requests from the HR chatbot and implement basic authentication.
    - Configure the Dialogflow agent to be able to provide authentication credentials when calling the webhook for fulfilment.
